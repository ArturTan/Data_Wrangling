    "1. The map was created by three users in almost 88%. It puts the quality of the map __in the question__, assuming that the higher number of users participating in creation of the map, the higher level of verification of the information contained therein. __Therefore__, improvement requires an engagement of the other open source volunteers who will verify and change the map, with the benefit for the passive users - for instance, the map will be a good  a reliable source for the parent as the information about the number of schools or kindergartens. Other locations should be also always verified. __However__, it could be very hard to monitor the state of locations, ways and nodes in Wrocław in real time. The gathering much larger number of users could also be difficult to achieve due to the organizational problems (it’s a so called human factor). \n",
    "2. What has been analyzed through queries above - \"SYM_UL\" tag could also cause some discrepancies for non-Polish GPS Systems. However, as this tag is congruent with other Polish systems of information provided by authorities, the benefits of using it for Polish users could be great. But open source community should prepare some uniform standard about the \"SYM_UL\" tag in order to eliminate possible system integration problems between Polish OSM and other GPS System. \n",
    "3. The problem with eliminating discrepancies between real state of ways / locations and Wrocław and OSM map is that you cannot make it on your own without help of others. However, some verification level you could achieve through checking the OSM content with Google Maps. This requires creation of relevant scripts enabling you to automate scraping information about locations and ways from Google Maps and verification  of this information with the data from OSM. "
